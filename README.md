# Image-Reconstruction
The project involves 2 main steps, such as making chosen images grey-scale and reconstruction of new image using the magnitude and phase information of images.

# Details

## image_reconstruction.py

_**The program has been done by running this exact file. This code file does 2 main proccesses.**_

  > **_Making two images grey-scale_**
  
  > **_Generating new image using magnitude information of one image and phase information of another._**
  
 ## Input images
 
 **_Clock and Valley images have been used for this purpose. However, you can use any other 2 images in order to have different results._**
 
 ## Results
 
 **_The folder is used to contain the results of the images, such as magnitude and phase information of all images and reconstructed image._**
